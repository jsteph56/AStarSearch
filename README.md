# AStarSearch
# This is my project creating an algorithm

- Project for Intro to A.I at UNCC
- Input a starting position from indices 0 - 14
- Input an ending position from the same indices
- Program will request a new set of positions if the given ones are 
- Once two valid positions are given the program will find the best path 
	from the given startNode to the given endNode and output the available path.
